This repository holds a vagrant PHP box. The application has the skeleton for a
PHP MVC application with user & session management.

    ```$ git clone https://github.com/hamzeen/vagrant-php-box.git```

    ```$ vagrant up```

* The application can now accessible from <http://localhost:1234> (The port could be changed in Vagrantfile)

* You need to visit **firstrun** page during first session to initialize the database schema and table(s). this
page is accessible from <http://localhost:1234/firstrun> (running it more than once will not halt the app **:)** )

* PhpMyAdmin is accessible from <http://localhost:1234/phpmyadmin>

* Vagrant sets up MySQL with following credentials:

    * Username: root
    * Password: root

* Some metadata related to this app
